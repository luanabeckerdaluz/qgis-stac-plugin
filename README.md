QGIS plugin for reading STAC APIs

Site https://stac-utils.github.io/qgis-stac-plugin

**The QGIS STAC API Browser currently lacks funding for maintenance,
bug fixes and new features; therefore development will be slow for now.
However weâ€™re dedicated to maintaining the project. 
For assistance or if you have funding to contribute 
please reach out to Kartoza ([info@kartoza.com](mailto:info@kartoza.com))**

### Installation

During the development phase the plugin is available to install via 
a dedicated plugin repository

Open the QGIS plugin manager, then select the **Settings** page, click **Add** 
button on the **Plugin Repositories** group box and use the above url to create
the new plugin repository.

After adding the new repository, the plugin should be available from the list
of all plugins that can be installed.
